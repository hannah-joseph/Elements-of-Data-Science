Palmer Penguin and Geographic Isolation
Data Owls: Hannah Joseph, Nina Hall, Sidra Droese, Sharaya Jordan, Hiro Das
Abstract: In this study, we examine the 344 penguin data collection. The data collection includes 3 species. The three species in the data set were found on three islands in Antarctica's Palmer Archipelago. The Chinstrap and Gentoo species of penguins would be the two species that would be the focus. The two species' body masses, bill lengths, and the depth and length of their bills all differ. On Biscoe Island and Dream Island, the two species coexist frequently. Due to the geographic isolation of some species, we developed a hypothesis regarding whether or not this isolation has an impact on the morphological differences between the Chinstrap and Gentoo species. The Gentoo and Chinstrap species would be tested in addition to the null hypothesis that there is no environmental impact. We gathered information about the various species in order to perform an exploratory analysis of them. The acquired data was put through statistical analysis to determine the species' p-value. The effects on the environment did not significantly affect the outcomes for the various species. This demonstrates how our null hypothesis, according to which there was no environmental influence on the evolution of the species, was accepted

Palmer Penguins
Welcome to the fascinating world of penguins, where flightless birds have evolved to become masters of the sea! In this dataset, we dive into the characteristics of different penguin species and how their adaptations have allowed them to thrive in their unique environments. See: https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/

Lets examine the Palmer Penguins
In our data set there are Various types of species of penguins including the Adelide, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins. These different species live across different Islands Including Dream, Biscoe and Torgesen. The Data shows differences in the Species, island, bill length(mm), flipper length(mm), body mass(g) and their sex.

Research Question: Is there an environmental impact on the evolution within or between species?
Gentoos are native to subantarctic islands, prolific hunters. Chinstrap Penguins islands in the South Atlantic, the Antarctic Peninsula, and New Zealand. Relatively small, only weighing about twelve pounds. Adelaide Penguins can swim nearly seven hundred and fifty miles away from their breeding site to hunt. On small islands all around the coast of Antarctica

Exploratory Analysis
If you're interested in exploring the different penguin groups and their characteristics, one great way to do this is by using the {group} method in Python. In particular, you can focus on the bill length in (mm) of the penguins, which is an important feature that distinguishes different penguin species. For example, you can compare the bill lengths of the Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins using a scatter plot to visualize any differences in the data.

scatter= penguin.group(["bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm"]).drop("Adelie")
scatter

penguin.where("species", are.not_equal_to('Adelie')).scatter("bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm", group = 'species')

Create a a table to explore the differences in amounts of penguins on the different islands

penguin.pivot("species","island")

Comparing Penguins
Now lets look specifically at the differences between Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins using [append] and [where] functions. First, create a table of only the selected penguins and then break those into two seperate tables.

G_and_C= penguin.where(("species"), are.equal_to('Gentoo')).append(penguin.where(('species'), are.equal_to('Chinstrap')))

Part 2
Now using the data science plan examine the different traits and the relationship between the two species of penguin.

Data Science Plan
Formulate hypothesis:

-Alternative: There is an environmental impact on evolution between Chinstrap and Gentoo species.

-Null: There is no environmental impact on the evolution between Chinstrap and Gentoo species.
